Many airports have moving conveyor belts in the corridors between halls and terminals. Instead of walking on the floor, passengers can choose to stand on a conveyor or, even better, walk on a conveyor to get to the end of the corridor much faster. The brand new Delft City Airport uses a similar system. However, in line with the latest fashion in airport architecture, there are no corridors: the entire airport is one big hall with a bunch of conveyor lines laid out on the floor arbitrarily. To get from a certain point A to a certain point B, a passenger can use any combination of walking on the floor and walking on conveyors. Passengers can hop on or off a conveyor at any point along the conveyor. It is also possible to cross a conveyor without actually standing on it.Walking on the floor goes at a speed of 1 meter/second.Walking forward on a conveyor goes at a total speed of 2 meter/second.Walking in reverse direction on a conveyor is useless and illegal, but you may walk on the floor immediately next to the conveyor. (Conveyors are infinitely thin.) How fast can you get from A to B?

### Built With

It's a pure C++ project. I've used a graphic library called SFML, really easy to use!

* See the documentation at [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Just clone the repository, install the following library, and run it in your IDE.
*Change C:/CLibraries/SFML with your SFML location path inside CMakeLists.txt
@DockerFile incoming soon anyway.

### Prerequisites

You only need to install one librabry to make it work:
* Installation guide: [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)

### Geometric
Something magic is happening when 30Â° are hitten by the intersect line and the conveyor one.
* Explanation (todo)
